Programming Assignment 7: Markov Model

Hours to complete assignment (optional):

/**********************************************************************
 * Describe the type parameters of your symbol table (i.e., what is   *
 * the key type and what is the value type). How did you use the      *
 * symbol table to implement the random() method.                     *

Our key type is a String of text while our value is an integer.  When in the
random method we just checked to see if out key value was equal or not to
the given stirng.

/**********************************************************************

 * random() method. Describe how you tested it.                       *
 **********************************************************************/
We tested it by using text generator to test if it produced character to their
weighted frequencies.

/**********************************************************************
 * Paste two of your favorite, not too long, output fragments here.   *
 * In addition to the pseudo-random text, indicate the order of your  *
 * model and what text file you used.                                 *
